# So Long

> This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites,
and some other very basic gameplay elements.

This project is one of the firsts from the 42 cursus where a graphic library is used.
[The MinilibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) is a very simple graphic library
based on the X-Window system. The version used in this repository is meant for MacOS.
